     * between any two beacons is pretty specific and unique.
     * For example, if we find a beacon with a neighbor 5.124m away and another neighbor at 17.632m away,
     * it's fairly safe to assume any other beacons reported by other scanners that also have a neighbor 5.124m away and

     * @param matchesNeeded The minimum number of exact matches required to conclude that two points are the same beacon
     * @return The position of that beacon as reported by this scanner, rotation and offset and all
